# Task Manager - Version 1.0.0

## Overview

The Task Manager is a command-line tool to help you manage tasks and their statuses. It allows you to add, delete, update, and mark tasks as "In Progress," "Done," or "Not Done." The tasks are stored in a JSON-like format in a file, making it easy to maintain and edit manually if needed.

## Features

- **Add tasks** with names and statuses.
- **Delete tasks** by their unique ID.
- **Update task** and task description.
- **Mark tasks as In Progress, Done, or Not Done.**
- Data is stored persistently in a file (`taskmanager.json`).

## Requirements

- Java 8 or later is required to run this program.

## Installation

1. **Clone or download** the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the code:
   ```sh
   javac Main.java
   ```

## Commands
### **Run the program** using the following command:
   ```sh
      java Main <command> [arguments]

### 1. Add a task:
  ```sh
      java Main add "<task_name>" "<task_description>"

### 2. Delete a task:

   ``` 
### 3. Update a task:

      java Main update <task_id> "<new_task_name>"
      # or
      java Main update <task_id> "<new_task_name>" "<new_task_description>"

   ```
### 4. Mark a task as Done:
   ```sh
      java Main mark-done <task_id>
   ```

   ```sh
      java Main mark-in-progress <task_id>

   ```

            OR
      java Main list "<task_status>"
   ```
   > **Note:**  Remember to give task names in double quotes and they are case sensitive
   - For example:
   -         "Done"

   -         "In progress"

   -         "Not done" 

## File Structure

- Main.java: The main Java program that contains all the logic for managing tasks.

- taskmanager.json: A JSON file that stores all the tasks in the format:
      
-    ```sh
             {
             "Task id": ["Task Name","Task description", "Status","Task created at","Task created at"]
              }
       ```
